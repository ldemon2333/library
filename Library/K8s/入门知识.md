_Pods_ are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A _Pod_ (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/), with shared storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

# Kubernetes 集群
**Kubernetes 协调一个高可用计算机集群，每个计算机作为独立单元互相连接工作。**

一个 Kubernetes 集群包含两种类型的资源：

- **控制面**调度整个集群
- **节点（Nodes）负责运行应用

**控制面负责管理整个集群。** 控制面协调集群中的所有活动，例如调度应用、维护应用的所需状态、应用扩容以及推出新的更新。

**节点是一个虚拟机或者物理机，它在 Kubernetes 集群中充当工作机器的角色。** 每个节点都有 Kubelet，它管理节点而且是节点与控制面通信的代理。 节点还应该具有用于​​处理容器操作的工具，例如 [containerd](https://containerd.io/docs/) 或 [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/#what-is-cri-o)。

Minikube 是一种轻量级的 Kubernetes 实现，可在本地计算机上创建 VM 并部署仅包含一个节点的简单集群。 Minikube 可用于 Linux、macOS 和 Windows 系统。Minikube CLI 提供了用于引导集群工作的多种操作， 包括启动、停止、查看状态和删除。


Kubernetes [**Pod**](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/) 是由一个或多个为了管理和联网而绑定在一起的容器构成的组。本教程中的 Pod 只有一个容器。 Kubernetes [**Deployment**](https://kubernetes.io/zh-cn/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) 检查 Pod 的健康状况，并在 Pod 中的容
器终止的情况下重新启动新的容器。 Deployment 是管理 Pod 创建和扩展的推荐方法。

Once you have a running Kubernetes cluster, you can deploy your containerized applications on top of it. To do so, you create a Kubernetes **Deployment**. The Deployment instructs Kubernetes how to create and update instances of your application. Once you've created a Deployment, the Kubernetes control plane schedules the application instances included in that Deployment to run on individual Nodes in the cluster.

Once the application instances are created, a Kubernetes Deployment controller continuously monitors those instances. If the Node hosting an instance goes down or is deleted, the Deployment controller replaces the instance with an instance on another Node in the cluster. **This provides a self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.**

# Deploying your first app on Kubernetes
You can create and manage a Deployment by using the Kubernetes command line interface, **kubectl**.

When you create a Deployment, you'll need to specify the container image for your application and the number of replicas that you want to run. You can change that information later by updating your Deployment;

For your first Deployment, you'll use a hello-node application packaged in a Docker container that uses NGINX to echo back all the requests.

## kubectl basics
The common format of a kubectl command is: `kubectl action resource`

To view the nodes in the cluster, run the **`kubectl get nodes`** command.

You see the available nodes. Later, Kubernetes will choose where to deploy our application based on Node available resources.

## Deploy an app
Let’s deploy our first app on Kubernetes with the `kubectl create deployment` command. We need to provide the deployment name and app image location (include the full repository url for images hosted outside Docker Hub).

**`kubectl create deployment kubernetes-bootcamp --image=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v1`**

You just deployed your first application by creating a deployment. This performed a few things for you:
- searched for a suitable node where an instance of the application could be run (we have only 1 available node)
- scheduled the application to run on that Node
- configured the cluster to reschedule the instance on a new Node when needed

## View the app
Pods that are running inside Kubernetes are running on a private, isolated network. By default they are visible from other pods and services within the same Kubernetes cluster, but not outside that network.

The `kubectl proxy` command can create a proxy that will forward communications into the cluster-wide, private network. The proxy can be terminated by pressing control-C and won't show any output while it's running.

We now have a connection between our host (the terminal) and the Kubernetes cluster. The proxy enables direct access to the API from these terminals.

You can see all those APIs hosted through the proxy endpoint. For example, we can query the version directly through the API using the `curl` command:

**`curl http://localhost:8001/version`**


# Viewing Pods and Nodes
A Pod is a Kubernetes abstraction that represents a group of one or more application containers (such as Docker), and some shared resources for those containers. Those resources include:
- Shared storage, as Volumes
- Networking, as a unique cluster IP address
- Information about how to run each container, such as the container image version or specific ports to use

Pods are the atomic unit on the Kubernetes platform. When we create a Deployment on Kubernetes, that Deployment creates Pods with containers inside them (as opposed to creating containers directly). Each Pod is tied to the Node where it is scheduled, and remains there until termination (according to restart policy) or deletion. In case of a Node failure, identical Pods are scheduled on other available Nodes in the cluster.

![[Pasted image 20250225093930.png]]
## Nodes
A Pod always runs on a **Node**. A Node is a worker machine in Kubernetes and may be either a virtual or a physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each Node is managed by the control plane. A Node can have multiple pods, and the Kubernetes control plane automatically handles scheduling the pods across the Nodes in the cluster. The control plane's automatic scheduling takes into account the available resources on each Node.

Every Kubernetes Node runs at least:
- Kubelet, a process responsible for communication between the Kubernetes control plane and the Node; it manages the Pods and the containers running on a machine.
- A container runtime (like Docker) responsible for pulling the container image from a registry, unpacking the container, and running the application.
![[Pasted image 20250225094307.png]]
A node is a worker machine in K8s and may be a VM or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Multiple Pods can run on one Node.

## Troubleshooting with kubectl
**`kubectl describe pods`**

We see here details about the Pod’s container: IP address, the ports used and a list of events related to the lifecycle of the Pod.

## Show the app in the terminal

## View the container logs
Anything that the application would normally send to standard output becomes logs for the container within the Pod. We can retrieve these logs using the `kubectl logs` command:

**kubectl logs "$POD_NAME"**

_**Note:** We don't need to specify the container name, because we only have one container inside the pod._

## Executing command on the container
We can execute commands directly on the container once the Pod is up and running. For this, we use the `exec` subcommand and use the name of the Pod as a parameter. Let’s list the environment variables:
`kubectl exec "$POD_NAME" -- env`

Next let’s start a bash session in the Pod’s container:

`kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME -- bash`

We have now an open console on the container where we run our NodeJS application. The source code of the app is in the server.js file:

`cat server.js`

You can check that the application is up by running a curl command:

`curl http://localhost:8080`

容器内部的 localhost:8080 端口

# Using a Service to Expose Your App
## Overview of K8s Services
K8s Pods are mortal. Pods have a lifecycle. When a worker node dies, the Pods running on the Node are also lost. A ReplicaSet might then dynamically drive the cluster back to the desired state via the creation of new Pods to keep your application running. That said, each Pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique IP address, even Pods on the same Node, so there needs to be a way of automatically reconciling changes among Pods so that your applications continue to function.

A Service in k8s is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. Services enable a loose coupling between dependent Pods. A Service is defined using YAML or JSON, like all Kubernetes object manifests. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a _label selector_ (see below for why you might want a Service without including a `selector` in the spec).

A K8s Service is an abstraction layer which defines a logical set of Pods and enables external traffic exposure, load balancing and service discovery for those Pods.

Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs are not exposed outside the cluster without a Service. Services allow your applications to receive traffic. Services can be exposed in different ways by specifying a `type` in the spec of the Service:
- _ClusterIP_ (default) - Exposes the Service on an internal IP in the cluster. This type makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.
- _NodePort_ - Exposes the Service on the same port of each selected Node in the cluster using NAT. Makes a Service accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. Superset of ClusterIP.
- _LoadBalancer_ - Creates an external load balancer in the current cloud (if supported) and assigns a fixed, external IP to the Service. Superset of NodePort.
- _ExternalName_ - Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g. `foo.bar.example.com`), by returning a `CNAME` record with its value. No proxying of any kind is set up. This type requires v1.7 or higher of `kube-dns`, or CoreDNS version 0.0.8 or higher.

## Services and Labels
A Service routes traffic across a set of Pods. Services are the abstraction that allows pods to die and replicate in Kubernetes without impacting your application. Discovery and routing among dependent Pods (such as the frontend and backend components in an application) are handled by Kubernetes Services.

Services match a set of Pods using [labels and selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels), a grouping primitive that allows logical operation on objects in Kubernetes. Labels are key/value pairs attached to objects and can be used in any number of ways:
- Designate objects for development, test, and production
- Embed version tags
- Classify an object using tags
![[Pasted image 20250225104400.png]]
### Step 1: Creating a new Service
We have a Service called kubernetes that is created by default when minikube starts the cluster. To create a new service and expose it to external traffic we'll use the expose command with NodePort as parameter.

**kubectl expose deployment/kubernetes-bootcamp --type="NodePort" --port 8080**

To find out what port was opened externally (for the type: NodePort Service) we’ll run the `describe service` subcommand:

**kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp**

Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node port assigned:

**export NODE_PORT="$(kubectl get services/kubernetes-bootcamp -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')"**

**echo "NODE_PORT=$NODE_PORT"**

Now we can test that the app is exposed outside of the cluster using `curl`, the IP address of the Node and the externally exposed port:

**curl http://"$(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT"**

> Note:
> 
If you're running minikube with Docker Desktop as the container driver, a minikube tunnel is needed. This is because containers inside Docker Desktop are isolated from your host computer.

In a separate terminal window, execute:  
`minikube service kubernetes-bootcamp --url`

The output looks like this:

**http://127.0.0.1:51082  
!  Because you are using a Docker driver on darwin, the terminal needs to be open to run it.**

Then use the given URL to access the app:  
`curl 127.0.0.1:51082`

And we get a response from the server. The Service is exposed.

### Step 2: Using labels
The Deployment created automatically a label for our Pod. With the `describe deployment` subcommand you can see the name (the _key_) of that label:

**kubectl describe deployment**

Let’s use this label to query our list of Pods. We’ll use the `kubectl get pods` command with -l as a parameter, followed by the label values:

**kubectl get pods -l app=kubernetes-bootcamp**


# Running Multiple Instances of Your App
## Scaling an application
Exposed it publicly via a Service. The Deployment created only one Pod for running our application. When traffic increases, we will need to scale the application to keep up with user demand.

_Scaling_ is accomplished by changing the number of replicas in a Deployment

You can create from the start a Deployment with multiple instances using the --replicas parameter for the kubectl create deployment command.

## Scaling overview
Scaling out a Deployment will ensure new Pods are created and scheduled to Nodes with available resources. Scaling will increase the number of Pods to the new desired state. Kubernetes also supports [autoscaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/) of Pods. Scaling to zero is also possible, and it will terminate all Pods of the specified Deployment.

Running multiple instances of an application will require a way to distribute the traffic to all of them. Services have an integrated load-balancer that will distribute network traffic to all Pods of an exposed Deployment. Services will monitor continuously the running Pods using endpoints, to ensure the traffic is sent only to available Pods.

Once you have multiple instances of an application running, you would be able to do Rolling updates without downtime.

## Scaling a Deployment
To list your Deployments, use the `get deployments` subcommand:

**kubectl get deployments**

The output should be similar to:
![[Pasted image 20250225113834.png]]
This shows:
- _NAME_ lists the names of the Deployments in the cluster.
- _READY_ shows the ratio of CURRENT/DESIRED replicas
- _UP-TO-DATE_ displays the number of replicas that have been updated to achieve the desired state.
- _AVAILABLE_ displays how many replicas of the application are available to your users.
- _AGE_ displays the amount of time that the application has been running.

To see the ReplicaSet created by the Deployment, run:

**kubectl get rs**

Notice that the name of the ReplicaSet is always formatted as [DEPLOYMENT-NAME]-[RANDOM-STRING]. The random string is randomly generated and uses the _pod-template-hash_ as a seed.

Two important columns of this output are:
- _DESIRED_ displays the desired number of replicas of the application, which you define when you create the Deployment. This is the desired state.
- _CURRENT_ displays how many replicas are currently running.

Next, let’s scale the Deployment to 4 replicas. We’ll use the `kubectl scale` command, followed by the Deployment type, name and desired number of instances:

**kubectl scale deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp --replicas=4**

The change was applied, and we have 4 instances of the application available. Next, let’s check if the number of Pods changed:

**kubectl get pods -o wide**

There are 4 Pods now, with different IP addresses. The change was registered in the Deployment events log. To check that, use the describe subcommand:

**kubectl describe deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp**

## Load Balancing
Let's check that the Service is load-balancing the traffic. To find out the exposed IP and Port we can use the describe service as we learned in the previous part of the tutorial:

**kubectl describe services/kubernetes-bootcamp**

Next, we’ll do a `curl` to the exposed IP address and port. Execute the command multiple times:

**curl http://"$(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT"**

We hit a different Pod with every request. This demonstrates that the load-balancing is working.

The output should be similar to:
![[Pasted image 20250225115532.png]]

# Performing a Rolling Update
## Updating an application
Users expect applications to be available all the time, and developers are expected to deploy new versions of them several times a day. In Kubernetes this is done with rolling updates.
 A **rolling update** allows a Deployment update to take place with zero downtime. It does this by incrementally replacing the current Pods with new ones. The new Pods are scheduled on Nodes with available resources, and Kubernetes waits for those new Pods to start before removing the old Pods.

Similar to application Scaling, if a Deployment is exposed publicly, the Service will load-balance the traffic only to available Pods during the update. An available Pod is an instance that is available to the users of the application.

Rolling updates allow the following actions:

- Promote an application from one environment to another (via container image updates)
- Rollback to previous versions
- Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery of applications with zero downtime

In the following interactive tutorial, we'll update our application to a new version, and also perform a rollback.

## Update the version of the app
To view the current image version of the app, run the `describe pods` subcommand and look for the `Image` field:

**kubectl describe pods**

To update the image of the application to version 2, use the `set image` subcommand, followed by the deployment name and the new image version:

**kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=docker.io/jocatalin/kubernetes-bootcamp:v2

The command notified the Deployment to use a different image for your app and initiated a rolling update. Check the status of the new Pods, and view the old one terminating with the `get pods` subcommand:


## Verify an update
Next, do a `curl` to the exposed IP and port:

Every time you run the `curl` command, you will hit a different Pod. Notice that all Pods are now running the latest version (v2).

You can also confirm the update by running the `rollout status` subcommand:

**kubectl rollout status deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp**

To view the current image version of the app, run the `describe pods` subcommand:

`kubectl describe pods`

In the `Image` field of the output, verify that you are running the latest image version (v2).

## Roll back an update
Let’s perform another update, and try to deploy an image tagged with `v10`:

**kubectl set image deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp kubernetes-bootcamp=gcr.io/google-samples/kubernetes-bootcamp:v10**

Use `get deployments` to see the status of the deployment:

**kubectl get deployments**

Notice that the output doesn't list the desired number of available Pods. Run the `get pods` subcommand to list all Pods:

**kubectl get pods**

Notice that some of the Pods have a status of ImagePullBackOff.

To get more insight into the problem, run the `describe pods` subcommand:

**kubectl describe pods**

In the `Events` section of the output for the affected Pods, notice that the `v10` image version did not exist in the repository.

To roll back the deployment to your last working version, use the `rollout undo` subcommand:

**kubectl rollout undo deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp**

The `rollout undo` command reverts the deployment to the previous known state (v2 of the image). Updates are versioned and you can revert to any previously known state of a Deployment.

The Deployment is once again using a stable version of the app (v2). The rollback was successful.

Remember to clean up your local cluster

**kubectl delete deployments/kubernetes-bootcamp services/kubernetes-bootcamp**
