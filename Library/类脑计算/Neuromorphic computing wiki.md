Neuromorphic engineering translates what we know about the brain's function into computer systems. Work has mostly focused on replicating the analog nature of [biological computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_computation "Biological computation") and the role of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron") in [cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition "Cognition").

 A key feature of biological brains is that all of the processing in neurons uses analog [chemical signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signalling "Cell signalling"). This makes it hard to replicate brains in computers because the current generation of computers is completely digital. However, the characteristics of these chemical signals can be abstracted into mathematical functions that closely capture the essence of the neuron's operations.

The goal of neuromorphic computing is not to perfectly mimic the brain and all of its functions, but instead to extract what is known of its structure and operations to be used in a practical computing system.No neuromorphic system will claim nor attempt to reproduce every element of neurons and synapses, but all adhere to the idea that computation is highly [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_processing "Distributed processing") throughout a series of small computing elements analogous to a neuron. While this sentiment is standard, researchers chase this goal with different methods.
