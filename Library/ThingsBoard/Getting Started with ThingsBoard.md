- Connect devices to ThingsBoard;
- Push data from devices to ThingsBoard;
- Build real-time end-user dashboards;
- Define thresholds and trigger alarms;
- Set up push notifications about new alarms over email, SMS, or other systems.

**In this guide, we will connect and visualize data from the temperature sensor to keep it simple.**
