For this transformation, those are all the vectors with this special property of staying on their span: Those on the xx-axis that get stretched by a factor of 33, and those on this diagonal line that are stretched by a factor of 22. Any other vector will get rotated somewhat during the transformation, knocked off of the line it spans.

线性变换后仍保持在它向量所张成的空间中，只是大小发生了改变，缩放因子称为特征值，该向量成为特征向量。

For a glimpse of why this might be a useful thing to think about, consider some three-dimensional rotation. If you can find an eigenvector for this rotation, a vector which remains on its own span, what you have found is the axis of rotation.

The only way it's possible for the product of a matrix with a nonzero vector to become zero is if the transformation associated with that matrix squishes space into a lower dimension. And that squishification corresponds to a zero determinant of the matrix.
