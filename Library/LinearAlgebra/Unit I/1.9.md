# Solving $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$: row reduced form $R$
When does $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ have solutions $\mathbf{x}$, and how can we describe those solutions?

# Solvability conditions on $\mathbf{b}$
We again use the example:
$$
A = \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1&2&2&2\\
2&4&6&8\\
3&6&8&10
\end{array}\right].
$$
The third row of $A$ is the sum of its first and second rows, so we know that if $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ the third component of $\mathbf{b}$ equals the sum of its first and second components. If $\mathbf{b}$ does not satisfy $b_3 = b_1+b_2$ the system has no solution.

Row 3 of $A$ is completely eliminated:
$$
\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
1&2&2&2&b_1\\
2&4&6&8&b_2\\
3&6&8&10&b_3
\end{array}\right]
\rightarrow
\cdots
\rightarrow
\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}
1&2&2&2&b_1\\
0&0&2&4&b_2-2b_1\\
0&0&0&0&b_3-b_2-b_1
\end{array}\right].
$$
If $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ has a solution, then $b_3-b_2-b_1 = 0$. For example, we could choose $\mathbf{b} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\5\\6 \end{array}\right]$.

We know that $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is solvable exactly when $\mathbf{b}$ is in the column space $C(A)$.

# Complete solution
## A particular solution
Set all free variables to zero, then solve for the pivot variables.

For our example matrix $A$, we let $x_2=x_4=0$ to get the system of equations, and our particular solution is:
$$
\mathbf{x}_p=\left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\0\\3/2\\0 \end{array}\right].
$$

## Combined with the nullspace 
The general solution to $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is given by $\mathbf{x}_{complete} = \mathbf{x}_p+\mathbf{x}_n$ is a generic vector in the nullspace. To see this, we add$A \mathbf{x}_p = \mathbf{b}$ to$A \mathbf{x}_n = \mathbf{b}$ and get $A \left(\mathbf{x}_p+\mathbf{x}_n\right) = \mathbf{b}$ for every vector $\mathbf{x}_n$ in the nullspace.

So the complete solution to the equation $A\mathbf{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{c} 1\\5\\6 \end{array}\right]$ is:
$$
\mathbf{x}_{complete} = \left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\0\\3/2\\0 \end{array}\right]+c_1
\left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\1\\0\\0 \end{array}\right]
+c_2
\left[ \begin{array}{r} 2\\0\\-2\\1 \end{array}\right],
$$
where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are real numbers.

The nullspace of $A$ is a two dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$, and the solutions to the equation $A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ form a plane parallel to that through $\mathbf{x}_p=\left[ \begin{array}{r} -2\\0\\3/2\\0 \end{array}\right]$.

# Rank
The rank of a matrix equals the number of pivots of that matrix. If $A$ is an $m$ by $n$ matrix of rank $r$, we know $r\leq m$ and $r\leq n$.

## Full column rank
If $r=n$, then from the previous lecture we know that the nullspace has dimension $n-r=0$ and contains only the zero vector. There are no free variables or special solutions.

We know $r\leq m$, so if $r=n$ the number of columns of the matrix is less than or equal to the number of rows. The row reduced echelon form of the matrix will look like $R = \left[ \begin{array}{r} I\\0 \end{array}\right]$.  For any vector $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ that's not a linear combination of the columns of $A$, there is no solution to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.

## Full row rank
If $r=m$, then the reduced matrix $R=\left[\begin{array}{ll}I & F \end{array}\right]$ has no rows of zeros and so there are no requirements for the entries of $\mathbf{b}$ to satisfy. The equation $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ is solvable for every $\mathbf{b}$. There are $n-r=n-m$ free variables, so there are $n-m$ special solutions to $A\mathbf{x} =0$.

## Full row and column rank
If $r=m=n$ is the number of pivots of $A$, then $A$ is an invertible square matrix and $R$ is the identity matrix. The nullspace has dimension zero, and $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ has a unique solution for every $\mathbf{b}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
