# The four fundamental subspaces
In this lecture we discuss the four fundamental spaces associated with a matrix and the relations between them.

# Four subspaces
Any $m$ by $n$ matrix $A$ determines four subspaces (possibly containing only the zero vector):

## Column space, $C(A)$
$C(A)$ is a vector space in $\mathbb{R}^m$.

## Nullspace, $N(A)$
This consists of all solution $\mathbf{x}$ of the equation $A\mathbf{x}=0$ and lies in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Row space, $C(A^T)$
Form a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$.

## Left nullspace, $N(A^T)$
We call the nullspace of $A^T$ the _left nullspace_ of $A$. This is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$

# Basis and Dimension
## Column space

The $r$ pivot columns form a basis for $C(A)$

dim $C(A)=r$.

## Nullspace
dim $N(A)=n-r$

## Row space
dim $C(A^T)=r$

## Left nullspace
dim $N(A^T)=m-r$

The left nullspace is the collection of vectors $y$ for which $A^T y=0$. Equivalently, $y^T A = 0$; here $y$ and $0$ are row vectors. We say "left nullspace" because $y^T$ is on the left of $A$ in this equation.


# New vector space
The collection of all $3\times 3$ matrices forms a vector space; call it $M$. We can add matrices and multiply them by scalars and there's a zero matrix. 

Some subspaces of $M$ include:
- all upper triangular matrices
- all symmetric matrices
- $D$, all diagonal matrices
