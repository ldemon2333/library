# Review of subspaces
A vector space is a collection of vectors which is closed under linear combinations. In other words, for any two vectors $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{w}$ in the space and any two real numbers $c$ and $d$, the vector $c\mathbf{v}+d\mathbf{w}$ is also in the vector space.

A plane $P$ containing $\left[ \begin{align}0\\0\\0 \end{align}\right]$ and a line $L$ containing $\left[ \begin{align}0\\0\\0 \end{align}\right]$ are both subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^3$. The union $P\cup L$ of those two subspaces is generally not a subspace, because the sum of a vector in $P$ and a vector in $L$ is probably not contained in $P\cup L$. The intersection $S\cap T$ of two subspaces $S$ and $T$ is a subspace. To prove this, use the fact that both $S$ and $T$ are closed under linear combinations to show that their intersection is closed under linear combinations.

# Column space of $A$
The _column space_ of a matrix $A$ is the vector space made up of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$.

If there is a solution $\mathbf{x}$ to $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$, then $\mathbf{b}$ must be a linear combination of the columns of $A$.

# Nullspace of $A$
The _nullspace_ of a matrix $A$ is the collection of all solutions $\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{align} x_1 \\x_2 \\x_3 \end{align} \right]$ to the equation $A\mathbf{x} = 0$.

# 1.8 Solving Ax = 0: Pivot Variables, Special Solutions
How do we compute these  subspaces?

# Computing the nullspace
Suppose:
$$
A= \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 2 &2&2\\
2&4&6&8\\
3&6&8&10
\end{array}
\right]
$$
(Note that the column of this matrix $A$ are not independent).

The row operations used in the method of elimination don't change the solution $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$ so they don't change the nullspace. (They do affect the column space).

The first step of elimination gives us:
$$
A= \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 2 &2&2\\
2&4&6&8\\
3&6&8&10
\end{array}
\right]
\longrightarrow
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 2 &2&2\\
0&0&2&4\\
0&0&0&0
\end{array}
\right]=U
$$
The matrix $U$ is in echelon (staircase) form. The third row is zero because row 3 was a linear combination of rows 1 and 2; it was eliminated.

The _rank_ of a matrix $A$ equals the number of pivots it has.

# Special solutions
Once we're found $U$ we can use back-substitution to find the solutions $\mathbf{x}$ th the equation $U\mathbf{x}=0$. In our example, columns 1 and 3 are _pivot columns_ containing pivots, and columns 2 and 4 are _free columns_. We can assign any value to $x_2$ and $x_4$; we call these _free variables_. Suppose $x_2=1$ and $x_4=0$. Then:

One solution is $\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{align} -2 \\1 \\0\\0 \end{align} \right]$.

Letting a different free variable equal 1 and setting the other free variables equal to zero gives us other vectors in the nullspace and we get another solution:
$$
\mathbf{x}=\left[\begin{align} 2 \\0 \\-2\\1 \end{align} \right]
$$
The nullspace of $A$ is the collection of all linear combinations of these special solution vectors.

The rank $r$ of $A$ equals the number of pivor columns, so the number of free columns is $n-r$. This equals the number of special solutions vectors and the dimension of the nullspace.

# Reduced row echelon form
By containing to use the method of elimination we can convert $U$ to a matrix $R$ in _reduced row echelon form_ (rref form), with pivots equal to 1 and zeros above and below the pivots.
$$
U= \left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 2 &2&2\\
0&0&2&4\\
0&0&0&0
\end{array}
\right]
\longrightarrow
\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 2 &0&-2\\
0&0&1&2\\
0&0&0&0
\end{array}
\right]=R.
$$
By exchanging some columns, $R$ can be rewritten with a copy of the identity matrix in the upper left corner, possibly followed by some free columns on the right. If some rows of $A$ are linearly dependent, the lower rows of the matrix $R$ will be filled with zeros:
$$
R= \left[\begin{array}{cc}
I & F \\
0&0
\end{array}
\right].
$$
(Here $I$ is an $r$ by $r$ square matrix.)

If $N$ is the _nullspace matrix_ $N=\left[\begin{array}{c} - F \\ I \end{array}\right]$ then $RN=0$. (Here $I$ is an $n-r$ by $n-r$ square matrix and $0$ is an $m$ by $n-r$ matrix). The columns of $N$ are the special solutions.
