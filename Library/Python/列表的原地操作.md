The two statements `nums[:] = sorted(set(nums))` and `nums = sorted(set(nums))` both aim to assign a sorted list of unique elements from `nums` to `nums`, but they do it in slightly different ways with different implications. Here's a detailed breakdown of the differences:

### `nums[:] = sorted(set(nums))`

1. **In-place Modification**: This operation modifies the existing list `nums` in place. The slice notation `nums[:]` means that the entire content of the list is replaced by the new sorted list of unique elements.
2. **Preserves List Identity**: Since the list is modified in place, the identity of the list `nums` remains the same. This means that any other variable or reference pointing to this list will see the updated values.
3. **Side Effects**: If there are other variables that reference the same list object as `nums`, they will also reflect the changes because the list object itself is modified.

### `nums = sorted(set(nums))`

1. **Re-assignment**: This operation creates a new list that contains the sorted unique elements from `nums` and then re-assigns the variable `nums` to this new list.
2. **Changes List Identity**: The identity of the list `nums` changes because `nums` now points to a new list object. Any other variable that referenced the old list will not see the changes.
3. **No Side Effects**: Since `nums` is re-assigned to a new list, other references to the old list remain unaffected.

### Example to Illustrate the Difference

```python
# Example for nums[:] = sorted(set(nums))
nums1 = [3, 1, 2, 3]
original_reference = nums1
nums1[:] = sorted(set(nums1))
print(nums1)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(original_reference is nums1)  # Output: True

# Example for nums = sorted(set(nums))
nums2 = [3, 1, 2, 3]
original_reference = nums2
nums2 = sorted(set(nums2))
print(nums2)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(original_reference is nums2)  # Output: False
```

In summary:
- Use `nums[:] = sorted(set(nums))` when you need to update the original list in place, preserving references to the original list object.
- Use `nums = sorted(set(nums))` when you want to create a new list and assign it to `nums`, without affecting other references to the original list.
