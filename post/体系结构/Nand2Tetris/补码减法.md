# 补码减法的另一种实现
## 补码减法的常规实现
[x-y]补=[x]补+[-y]补
[-y]补的求法就是[y]补连同符号位取反再加1
也就是
if we use !x to indicate the bitwise inverse of x and -x to indicate the arithmetic inverse of x (i.e., the number such that x + -x = 0) then we have

-x = (!x) + 1 //求[-x]补

This means that 
!x = -x-1

## 求-x的另一种实现
Let's now consider what the arithmetic result is if we configure the Hack ALU to perform the following:

out = !(x+! 0)

In other words, for y to be zero and then invert it, add this to x, and then invert the ALU output.

out = !(x+! 0) = !(x+(-0-1)) = !(x-1) = -(x-1)-1 = -x

再看y-x的实现，根据表格可知y-x = !(x+!y)，证明：The old "flip the bits and add one" description of arithmetic inverse in two's complement.

Proof: y-x = !(x+!y)

!(x+!y) = !(x + (-y-1)) = -(x-y-1)-1 = -x+y = y-x
