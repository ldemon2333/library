# Question:
- [ ] 程序是如何终止的，以及当系统中没有程序运行时，OS应该做什么  
SOL:You don't want your computer wandering through memory executing whatever junk it finds there, since you have no idea what will happen. If your computer is controlling things in the real world, the consequences could be disastrous. Even if it's not, you risk messing things up -- interpreting the contents of memory to be a command to change the contents of the screen, corrupting the image your program just created, or initiating a low-level format of your hard drive. You want your computer to always be well-behaved, and that means always doing what you want and expect it to do. If you can't stop the clock or otherwise put it to sleep, it will insist on executing instructions, so give it something benign to do with its time, like run an infinite loop.
